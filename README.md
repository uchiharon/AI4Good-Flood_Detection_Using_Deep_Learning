# Flood Damage Detection Model
## Project Overview (In progress)
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to accurately detect and assess areas damaged by flooding. Utilizing advanced image processing and deep learning techniques, this model aims to provide rapid and reliable damage assessments, which are crucial for effective disaster response and recovery efforts.

## Features
Damage Detection: Utilizes state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to analyze aerial or satellite imagery and identify flood-affected areas.
Damage Assessment: Classifies the severity of damage to aid in prioritizing response efforts.
Real-time Analysis: Designed to deliver quick results, enabling faster decision-making in critical situations.
High Accuracy: Trained on a diverse dataset to ensure reliable performance across different geographical locations.
